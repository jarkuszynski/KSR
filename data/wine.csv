Spain,Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.
US,Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.
Germany,Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.
Portugal,From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018.
Italy,Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish.
Italy,Intense aromas of ripe red berry, menthol, espresso and star anise lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers cranberry, dried Morello cherry, sage and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2025.
France,Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.
US,A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.
US,More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018‚Äì2034.
France,Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.
Chile,This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.
Chile,Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.
France,Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019.
US,The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.
US,A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.
US,This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.
Germany,Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.
Germany,Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.
Chile,Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.
US,This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.
Italy,Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods.
Chile,Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.
Italy,This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice.
US,Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.
France,The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.
US,This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.
US,Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.
Italy,Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins.
Argentina,With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torront√©s that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torront√©s should be. Drink now.
US,This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.
Chile,Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmen√®re (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
US,This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.
Italy,This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge‚Äîalmost too much‚Äîemphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.
Chile,Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.
Chile,Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.
Italy,Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.
Australia,From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling‚Äîan easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.
Italy,Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.
France,A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.
Italy,Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close.
Italy,This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart.
Italy,Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish.
US,This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes.
US,This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure.
Italy,Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years.
Italy,Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.
Portugal,A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.
US,This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rh√¥ne varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.
US,Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.
US,This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak.
US,Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.
France,Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.
France,This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020‚Äì2025.
Spain,Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.
US,This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, cr√®me de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.
US,This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourv√®dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.
Italy,Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019‚Äì2025.
Portugal,Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.
US,Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% S√©millon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.
US,Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.
Italy,This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.
Italy,Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018‚Äì2023.
Italy,Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.
Argentina,Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.
US,The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.
US,A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.
US,Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rh√¥ne wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.
US,Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gew√ºrtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.
Argentina,Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.
Australia,Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.
US,There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.
Italy,Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous ros√© eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.
US,Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.
US,Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.
Italy,The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.
Australia,The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down‚Äîbig and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.
US,A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.
France,Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.
US,Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.
US,Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.
US,This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.
Spain,Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.
Argentina,Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.
Australia,Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.
US,Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.
US,This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.
US,Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.
US,Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.
US,Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors‚Äîtomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.
US,Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.
Argentina,Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.
US,The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.
US,Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.
France,Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2‚Äì3 years, the wine will always be firm.
US,Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.
Argentina,A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.
US,Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.
US,A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink now‚Äì2014.
Argentina,For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.
Italy,This vineyard-designate blend of Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with a luminous golden color and elegant aromas of stone fruit, citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mature pear. There's a pretty hint of vanilla and almond butter at the back.
Italy,This sophisticated white wine from the homeland of Italy's most robust reds (Ripasso and Amarone) shows a full, generous appearance with a golden-amber color. Stone fruit, toasted almond and candied lemon give it heft and consistency.
Austria,Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion. There is acidity to balance and spice which, along with the full-bodied fruit character, makes the wine ready to drink now.
Italy,A gorgeous expression of Friulano, this wine (in a screwcap bottle) makes an elegant addition to chicken, pasta or seafood dinners. Layers of peach, almond and pineapple are wrapped tightly together.
Italy,This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice.
Argentina,Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.
Italy,This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.
Argentina,A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco.
US,A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic.
US,Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.
US,Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar.
Italy,This oak-fermented Sauvignon (in an artsy, screwcap bottle) delivers a rich, spicy finish and thick layers of peach, citrus, tomato leaf and honey-like aromas. It's a gorgeous wine that is an absolute pleasure to drink.
Austria,A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap.
US,This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.
Italy,This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015‚Äì2024.
US,Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.
Argentina,This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.
Austria,This is a very aromatic wine that's rich, spicy and with just a touch of ripeness. It has spiced pear, lychee and honey notes all balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity. Drink now and until 2020. Screwcap.
US,While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6‚Äì8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.
Spain,This is the stud in the Ac√∫stic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Bra√≥ is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.
Austria,While it feels rich and round, this is also a wine with a crisp side to it. Acidity cuts through ripe pear, apricot and lychee flavors, giving a decidedly crisp balance. It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap.
US,This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now.
France,This is a wine that has great potential‚Äîyou can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017.
Italy,This powerful Sagrantino opens with aromas of meat juice, truffle and black fruit. The palate offers blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon and black pepper, along with tobacco notes. It also has Sagrantino's trademark tannic backbone, but the tannins are ripe and are balanced by bright acidity.
France,Rich almonds, ripe peaches and a smoky, oxidized character all come together in this ripe, complex, fascinating wine. There is a great tang of apple acidity on the finish. Drink now.
Australia,This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.
Argentina,Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.

Portugal,This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins.

Germany,A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic sp√§tlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.
US,With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.

It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity.
Germany,Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Fr√ºhburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.
Italy,This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth.
Australia,This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic‚Äîalmost more of a light red than a true ros√©. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.
US,Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.
Chile,Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish.
US,The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.
US,This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last.
US,Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.
US,Not such a rarity these days, Albari√±o is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white.
Portugal,Sous√£o gives intense color and that, along with its attractive perfume, makes a dense, intensely fruity wine. It is rich and weighty, the tannins well integrated with a ripe, juicy aftertaste.
Portugal,The latest release from the partnership between the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro and the Cazes family of Ch√¢teau Lynch-Bages in Bordeaux. The wine brings out considerable minerality, a herbal edge along with forward black currant fruit. It is austerely structured at this stage and needs aging for several years.
Spain,Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.
Italy,Here's an elegant and clean blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from coastal Tuscany that offers intensity and well-measured aromas of ripe cherry, espresso bean and tobacco. The wine is plush and soft, with plump berry notes on the finish.

France,A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry.
US,Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.
Spain,Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.
US,Here's a big, rich, fruity Cabernet that satisfies for its array of blackberry, cherry, currant, mineral and oak flavors. It's dry and tannic, and the overall quality is quite high. The price makes it a good Buy. Drink through 2014

US,Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.
US,So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment. Petite Sirah can often be overpowering. This one's delicate, elegant and frankly delicious. Best now and over the next four years.
France,This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice.
Portugal,Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging. Very citrus with pineapple touches, it finishes with an herbaceous feel. The wine comes from a vineyard planted at the end of the 19th century.
US,A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite.

US,If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.
US,Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.
US,A riot of licorice, cassis, toast and berry, this 83% Cabernet Sauvignon/17% Petit Verdot Bordeaux-style blend is currently showing a lot of barrel flavors, with subdued but not insignificant fruit. Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.
Australia,This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now‚Äì2018.

US,Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.
US,Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy.
Italy,This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish.

Portugal,A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3‚Äì4 years.
US,White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose. The palate follows suit, remaining quiet and delicate in flavor concentration, yet loud in weight and texture. Salty citrus lingers on the finish.

Argentina,Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.
France,Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla. The palate is plush and fruit-forward, with ample acidity and medium tannins that lend pleasant structure. Accents of sweet spice grace the finish.
US,This light, refreshing ros√© mixes fresh strawberry fruit with apple-flavored acids. It's finished bone dry, with an almost dusty mouthfeel (in a good kind of way).

Italy,This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.
Argentina,Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.
Australia,Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish.
Portugal,A blend of Fern√£o Pires and Arinto, this is totally crisp and refreshingly fruity. It is perfumed, smooth while also cut with acidity. The acidity comes from both citrus and pineapple flavors. Drink now.

Portugal,Known in Spain as Graciano, this grape produces attractive, fruity wine especially in the Tejo region. This example is ripe with layers of acidity as well as a generous texture. Soft and smooth, it is ready to drink.
Australia,This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish.
US,An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.
Argentina,This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.
Portugal,This is crisp and fresh medium-sweet wine. It is bright with red-currant acidity and ripe with a strawberry and cream flavor. The wine is clean, lively and, of course, ready to drink.
Italy,Cellar floor, eucalyptus, black spice and a note recalling grilled celery lead the nose. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, star anise and a hint of orange zest while assertive, tightly knit tannins leave an astringent finish.
US,This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin.
Argentina,Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.
Italy,Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.
France,The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits. Tannins in the back give enough shape, although it will be ready to drink from early 2017.
France,While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character. The red-berry fruits and acidity are there, promising a fresh wine from 2018.

US,This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood‚Äî31% new and 26% once-used‚Äîseems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.
US,This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh.
Spain,Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.
US,This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture.
France,Neatly divided between the three major grapes of Champagne, this full, ripe wine is packed with rich apple and pear fruits. It is crisp while showing a high dosage giving a softer, smoother aftertaste. Drink this bottling now.
Spain,Cool aromas of cola, leather and black cherry set up a fairly full but fresh palate with moderate creamy weight. This tastes reedy and spicy, with wild-berry fruit, peppery notes and a distinct flavor of creamy oak. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting.
US,Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss.
Spain,Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good.
US,Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out.
US,Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe. Melon and vanilla appear on the nose and palate, with a side tone of pineapple, nutmeg and even clove, finishing clean and with simplicity.
US,Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels. The oak is integrated within this otherwise leathery, tannic and mild-mannered wine, ripe in cherry and cassis.
Portugal,Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now.

US,With a richness to the nose, this wine possesses a medium-sized body and moderate acidity, showcasing ripe apple, pear and tropical elements. The finish is focused in simple notions of preserved lemon and pineapple.
US,This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.
Spain,Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.
US,This new ‚Äúi‚Äù series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.
US,Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents.
Italy,This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish. Give it a few years to let the tannins unfurl then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.
Italy,Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note.
US,The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight.
Spain,Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness.
France,Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the C√¥te des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture.

France,This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.
France,A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.
France,From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around.
Italy,Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes.
Italy,Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.
Chile,Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away.
Italy,Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella‚Äîthree grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy‚Äîmake up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping ros√©. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry.
Chile,Good introductory Carmen√®re. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.
US,A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.
France,Although it is labeled ‚ÄúExtra Dry‚Äù (that is sweeter than Brut), this lively Champagne in its festive little pink bottle is very fresh, with delicious acidity. It finishes lightly, easily.
US,Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.
US,A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer.
US,It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast.
Italy,Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir. The results are a tad jammy and muddled (his vineyards are smack in the middle of the Mediterranean island), ending with ripe aromas of prune and raisin.
US,Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc.
US,Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.
US,A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne.
France,A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front.
Italy,This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.
France,This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.
Italy,This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity.
US,Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.
Argentina,Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.
Portugal,This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.
Australia,While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.
US,This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.
Spain,Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.
US,Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.
France,A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well.
France,Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.
France,A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.
France,An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.
Italy,Ed√®lmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.
Italy,Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.
Australia,Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now‚Äì2014.
US,Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.
US,Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.
US,Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.
Italy,Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood.
US,Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap.
France,The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.
France,Full, firm white wine that gives good green fruit and pear flavors, lifted with spice from wood. The wine is round, while still retaining crispness from grassy acidity, and offers a good depth of plum skin structure and flavor.
France,A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there‚Äîfresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling.
US,This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.
France,Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking.
Australia,Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.
Chile,Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva, with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure.
US,This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart‚Äîred fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.
US,Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.
Italy,This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.
Italy,Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins.
US,This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.
US,A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.
Italy,Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.
Italy,Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.
France,This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.
US,Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.
US,Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.
Argentina,Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.
Italy,Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.
France,The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now.
US,This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.
US,Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.
US,The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.
Spain,This lighter-bodied Menc√≠a from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.
Spain,Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.
US,There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.
Spain,Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.
US,Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.
France,With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste.
Italy,This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit.
Italy,An attractive fragrance of white flower, stone fruit, apple and a whiff of smoke opens this linear wine. The bright palate offers dried citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside brisk acidity.
US,This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.
Spain,Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albari√±o. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.
Argentina,Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.
Spain,A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.
Austria,The lightest in a range of Gr√ºner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.
Italy,The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close.
US,Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.
Italy,There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors.
US,This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.
France,Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.
France,Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste.
US,Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.
Spain,Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albari√±o and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.
US,Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.
Spain,With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.
Italy,Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth.
Austria,Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine,  the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now.
Austria,One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Gr√ºner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine ap√©ritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.
Chile,A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.
US,This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.
Italy,La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy. This is their Pinot Grigio from northern Italy that tastes rich and creamy and is made in a New World style. Aromas revolve around butter, almond paste, peach and apricot. It doesn't have huge length, but it does taste rich and dense.
France,As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.
France,For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This ros√©, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel.
Italy,Young spring flowers, lemongrass, green melon and dandelion come to mind and color what is a fresh wine with an easy, no-fuss approach. There's no big complicated story here, but that's exactly the point.
Italy,This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.
Portugal,Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.
US,Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.
US,This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.
US,With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.
US,Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.

On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023‚Äì2035.
Portugal,This is a major Douro wine from the Po√ßas family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019.

US,Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and cr√®me br√ªl√©e.
France,From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019.
Italy,This savory, firmly structured, full-bodied red opens with subtle dark berry, rose petal, pipe tobacco and crushed herb aromas. It delivers layers of juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and clove flavors, buttressed by youthfully assertive but refined tannins and nicely balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 2023‚Äì2033.
US,Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes‚Äîand seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.
US,This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.

US,Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.
US,Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky.
France,The Meridian in the name is the zero-longitude Prime Meridian which passes through this vineyard. The wine, with its minty flavors from new-wood aging, is serious, concentrated and with an impressive structure. The dark firm character of this wine promises plenty more aging. Drink from 2020.

US,All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect.

Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.
US,Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.

The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.
US,This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.
Portugal,Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026.
US,From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.
US,From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.

US,This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling.

Austria,Wild thyme and moss blaze a savory trail before honeyed sweetness, cut by wonderfully precise, lemon-sharp acidity. This is linear and superclean, and that wonderful sweet-acid contrast should make this BA a winner both with the dessert trolley and the cheeseboard.
US,There's a ying-yang of rich cr√®me br√ªl√©e, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.
US,With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.
France,This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rh√¥ne. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in body‚Äînot that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015.

US,Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019‚Äì2021.
US,Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.

Italy,Opening with aromas of underbrush, perfumed berries and crushed violets, this balanced Rosso displays its pedigree. The savory palate delivers dense wild cherry layered with orange peel, white pepper, mocha and cake spices alongside supple tannins. Energizing minerality signals the close. Enjoy now‚Äì2017.
Spain,This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.
US,One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.
US,Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018‚Äì2022.

France,This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success.
US,While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.
US,Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.
US,This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto C√£o (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souz√£o. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.
US,This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.
France,Based in the heart of the Haut-M√©doc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.
France,The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.
France,This wine is lean with acidity playing over the red-currant fruits, leaving a character that's light and tight. While the wine will soften it's not likely to show any more weight or richness.
Chile,Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic.
US,This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.
France,This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.
France,Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.
France,This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.
Chile,Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.
US,This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.
Italy,This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish.
Italy,This informal rosato offers delicate aromas and flavors of wild red berry and blood orange. It's rather lean and diluted, with bracing acidity.
US,An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.
US,Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.
Chile,Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.
US,Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.
US,After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.
US,This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.
France,This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity.
Italy,With the pale color of onion skin, this ros√© has muted aromas of damp earth and dried rose petal. The lean, diluted palate reveals suggestions of red berry alongside brisk acidity.
US,The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.
Italy,This lean red initially opens with a sulfur aroma that burns off to reveal steeped prune, dried violet and a hint of resin. The diluted, fleeting palate offers hints of black cherry and walnut skin.
France,Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste.
Chile,Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.
US,Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.
US,This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.
Austria,The focus of this full, rounded, soft Pinot Blanc is on the pear flavors. The mineral texture is about easy-drinking freshness allied to attractive acidity.
Australia,This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.
Austria,Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of Gr√ºner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades. But it also has good fresh acidity, which emphasizes the green fruit character of the wine, bringing out the crispness of the year. Screwcap.

Drink 2018‚Äì2028.
US,From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout.
Germany,Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gew√§chs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.

US,Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.
Italy,Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine.

Chile,There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.
Italy,This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins.
Italy,Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.
US,This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.
Chile,A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.
Australia,This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.
Chile,Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.
Chile,Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.
US,With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.
Argentina,Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.
France,A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.
US,The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.
US,Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.
Italy,This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.
Italy,Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza.
Italy,Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes.
Argentina,Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.
US,Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.
US,A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.
Argentina,Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.
Argentina,Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.
Italy,This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.
Chile,The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.
Italy,Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.
US,Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.
US,Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish. Polished and crisp, it has flavors of raspberries, cherries, tart cranberries and ripe pomegranates. The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.
Italy,Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice. On the palate, the wine is structured and firm, with a touch of sweet cherry on the finish.

France,Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years.

US,Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5‚Äì6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.

US,A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious.

The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.

But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.

US,This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.
US,Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills.

US,As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.

Italy,The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.
Italy,As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close.
Italy,Amarone producer Tommasi has produced this approachable blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet. The aromas are simple but direct, including cherry, spice and vanilla.

US,The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.

Australia,This is a straightforward, plump, fruity Chardonnay. Round peach and lemon flavors get a burst of energy from hints of pineapple and citrus, finishing clean and fresh. Drink now.
Spain,Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.
Italy,The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.
US,This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.
Spain,While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.

Portugal,A soft, lightly sweet style of ros√©, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good ap√©ritif wine.
Spain,This wine is a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gew√ºrz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.
US,With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.
Spain,Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.
Spain,The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.
Spain,White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.
Australia,Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.
US,The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class.

Spain,For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity. Drink through 2022.

Italy,Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose.

Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.
US,A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.
Italy,Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.
France,Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.
France,New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022.
France,This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.
France,One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
France,As is often the case with Ph√©lan S√©gur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019.
US,This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.
France,Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.
Spain,Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.
US,This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.
Spain,From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.
France,Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.
Spain,Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish.
US,This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourv√®dre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish.
France,Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.
France,This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016.
Spain,Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.
France,While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.
US,Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.
US,This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.
US,Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.
Spain,Pickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest. On the palate, this is soft and low on acidity. Flavors of raspberry, cherry and red currant are mild, with a touch of bitterness.
France,This crisp, fruity wine is fresh with citrus, grapefruit and an attractive zesty texture. Aromatic and bright, it is ready to drink now, clean and fragrant.
US,All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors.
France,Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.
France,This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.
Chile,Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.
France,From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure. It is juicy and with some acidity. Light and perfumed, it is ready to drink. The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-√âmilion grand cru.
US,A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.
France,Soft, ripe and fruity, this spicy wine has attractive acidity. It offers a light texture, pepper and a bite of orange zest at the end.
Chile,Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.
US,Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.
France,Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016. MACIF, a mutual insurance company, bought the estate in the 1980s and restored the vineyards and beautiful ch√¢teau. The estate manager is Fred√©ric Dubois and consultant is Georges Pauli.
France,This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997.
France,While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened.
France,Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017.
France,Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity.
US,This Southern Rh√¥ne-style blend is roughly half Mourv√®dre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourv√®dre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206‚Äì2022.
Italy,Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, black raspberry, black pepper and exotic spices alongside big, velvety tannins. Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.

France,Perfumed, ripe and packed with blackberry fruits, this wine displays a great sense of elegance. It is fresh while the solid structure provides a contrast of tannins. The end shows acidity and fruitiness.

US,This is a √ºber aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.
US,The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020‚Äì2022.
US,The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018‚Äì2019 in the cellar to gain traction.
US,It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.
Argentina,Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.
US,A rich barrel selection, this is a fine Pinot Noir that's silky, brisk in acidity, dry and deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. Give it at least until 2018 in the cellar.
US,Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished.
Italy,This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam. The rich palate delivers dark red cherry layered with mint and a tad of milk chocolate alongside dusty tannins. It' well balanced and should age moderately well. Drink 2016‚Äì2024.
US,A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.
US,Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, saut√©ed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.
US,This is pure Mourv√®dre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand R√™ve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.
Italy,Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015‚Äì2023.
Italy,From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.
France,Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.
France,Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.
Portugal,The local grape Castel√£o is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.
Portugal,It seems perverse to plant Gew√ºrztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.
France,This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now.
France,This wine is light, fruity and with only a slightly tannic character. Aromatic cherry flavors give freshness and bring out a jammy character. It's ready to drink.
US,Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!
Spain,Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.
France,Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink.
US,Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.
Spain,Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.
Spain,Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.
US,Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.
Portugal,A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now.
Portugal,While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now.
Spain,This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.
Argentina,Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.
Spain,Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish.
US,This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.
France,This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.
France,Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately.
France,Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now.
Portugal,Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.
Argentina,Salmon-colored and spritzy, this ros√© of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.
France,Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.
France,This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.
US,Forest berries, perfumed violets and pine needles entertain the nose on this widely available bottling. The palate shows dried herbs, tar and smashed blackberries.
France,This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors‚Äîa bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.
Spain,Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Menc√≠a and other grapes.
Spain,Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.
US,This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.
US,The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a ros√© of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.
US,Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.
US,Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of.
Spain,This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.
US,Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.
Spain,Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.
US,Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind.
France,Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now.
US,This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.
US,Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.
US,From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.
US,With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.
US,Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.
Spain,Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.
Argentina,Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.
Spain,Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.
Spain,Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.
Spain,Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.
Spain,Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.
US,Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.
US,Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish.
Argentina,Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.
France,This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted.
US,Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.
Spain,Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.
Argentina,This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.
US,An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.
US,This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart.
